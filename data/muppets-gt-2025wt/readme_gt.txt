These ground truth data were originally created by two students from the winter term 2020/21. I would like to thank Baris Kalayci and Sebastian Georg Röder for providing them to the SIM12 students. In 2025 the ground truth was extended and refined by diploma student Ashish Negi - thank you very much!
